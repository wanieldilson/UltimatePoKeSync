## Pokémon Showdown Gen 3 Random Battle sets

The embedded Random Battle sets and the generated Gen 3 move catalog are derived from
Pokémon Showdown:

- Move metadata: https://github.com/smogon/pokemon-showdown/blob/db93869dcc216c0be39e7f86e9a64edcc7496d89/data/moves.ts

## Pokémon Showdown Gen 5 move metadata

The same pinned commit. Gen 5 values are reconstructed by applying Showdown's own
per-generation overrides — `data/mods/gen8`, `gen7`, `gen6`, `gen5` — over `data/moves.ts`,
because the base file holds the current generation's numbers. See D-041.

- Files: `data/moves.ts`, `data/mods/gen{8,7,6,5}/moves.ts`
- Importer: `tools/import-showdown-gen5-data.mjs`

## Pokémon Showdown Gen 5 Random Battle sets

The same pinned commit again, and the same standing as the Gen 3 sets: expert-authored role
and movepool examples, not standard OU usage. See D-024 and D-044.

- File: https://github.com/smogon/pokemon-showdown/blob/db93869dcc216c0be39e7f86e9a64edcc7496d89/data/random-battles/gen5/sets.json
- Revision: `db93869dcc216c0be39e7f86e9a64edcc7496d89`
- Retrieved: 2026-08-10

Level-up learnsets were also imported from Showdown until 2026-08-11. They now come from
PKHeX.Core, which holds a separate table per game rather than one per generation (D-027).
